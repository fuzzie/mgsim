     *
     * 'address' always indicates the cache-line the message concerns.
     * 
     * For requests, the 'hops' field is incremented whenever the request
     * misses a cache and/or directory. For responses, it designates the
     * destination by being decremented and forwarded until it's zero.
     * Responses are routed purely on this counter.
     *
     * 'data':
     * Only has a meaning for RESPONSE_READ and holds the data that has
     * been read.
     * 
     * 'tokens':
     * For REQUEST_READ and REQUEST_UPDATE it has no meaning (should be 0).
     * For REQUEST_EVICT it indicates how many tokens the eviction carries.
     * For REQUEST_KILL_TOKENS it indicates how many tokens to kill.
     * For RESPONSE_READ it indicates how many tokens the destination
     * cache got from the sender.
     * For RESPONSE_FORWARD it indicates how many hops are between the
     * destination and the next cache that the destination should forward
     * its data to.
