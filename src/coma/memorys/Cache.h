    // 2. read on read pending line (the corresponding merged line should not be locked )with tokens, even ghost tokens, can be perfomed on the line directly and return.
    // 3. write on write pending lines with priority token can be performed directly according to the following rules
    //    a. it can be performed on the merged store line but no return, if the AT request was from a different family.
    //    b. if the AT request was from the same family, the request can be performed directly on the line and return immediately.  [N/A yet]
    //    *. if no knowledge about the family, then the request should be performed on the MSB without return.
    // 4. write on read pending line with priority token can be performed on the line directly and no immediate return,
    //    but the merged AT/AD needs to be send out and also change the state to writepending immediately 
    //    (additional line state needs to remember the outgoing AT request) [N/A yet]
    // 5. write on writepending lines without priority tokens may write to merge store buffer if availablei and no immediate return.
    //    a. write to unlocked merged lines can proceed directly with no immediate return.
    //    b. write to locked merged lines will be blocked (or proceeded according to previous request initiators on the merge buffer TBD)
    // 6. read on the writepending lines without priority tokens are more delicate, since read always needs to read the whole line
    //    a. if a merged buffer is not locked, it can proceeed, otherwise it will be blocked to suspend in the normal queue
    //    b. read might need to combine both line and merged store buffer, as long as the data are available, it can read and return;
    //       merged store buffer has the priority, if both line and merged buffer has the data, line data is ignored
    //    c. when a read fails, the buffer slot/line will be set as locked (or a bitmapping for the read initiator is updated to improve the performance TBD) 
    //       and preventing others (illegal ones) from access the data
    // 7. write on read pending line without priority token will have to write to merge buffer (or maybe just suspend, since it might waste too much MSB TBD) [N/A yet]
    //    a. write can proceed with no immediate reply, 
    //    b. update on the merged request is of course automatic
    // 8. whenever the writepending line gets the priority token, the line will directly merge with the corresponding merge store buffer line
    //    the merged request for the merge store line will be eliminated, 
    //    and all the following write requests suspended on the merged line will be directly returend without processing.
    //    this can happen also after the AD/AT request returns
    // 9. whenever read pending line get priority token, (T cannot possibly get priority token, only R can), merge write buffer will be directly merged with the line 
    //    and change the state to write pending state, merged request has to be sent out to invalidate others.    [N/A yet]

    // *  any request suspended on the merge store line will be queued and a merged request will gather all the data in those request
    // *  any unavailablility of the merge store buffer will cause the incoming request to suspend on normal queues
    // *  merge buffer slot/line are locked or not is decided by the llock variable
    // *  all request without immediate reply to the processor, will have to be queued in the merged line queue. 
    //    the merged line queue will be served before any other requests suspended on the line or even in the pipeline
