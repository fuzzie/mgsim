# Print a version string.

# This script is derived from git-version-gen originally from GIT:
# http://git.or.cz/ and modified for use in GNUlib, M4, Bison and
# other GNU software.
# It may be run in two ways:
# - from a VC repository in which the "svnversion" or "git describe"
#   produce useful output and a "package-version" file exists.
# - from a non-VC repo directory containing a tarball-version file.
#
# It differs from the original git-version-gen in that the version
# number is derived from the content of a version file, not a tag
# name in the SCM repository.
#
# Also it supports local checkouts from both git and svn.
#
# The script should be invoked as:
#     version-gen <location of tarball-version> <location of package-version>
#
# A version number is composed of two parts:
#
# - a "fixed" part, which is set by the developer in the
#   "package-version" file and reflects the overall state of the
#   software. This must start with a digit and can be of any shape. An
#   example scheme is X.Y.Z where X is the major version (indicating
#   large changes that cause incompatibilities), Y the minor version
#   (indicating feature additions) and Z the revision (indicating bug
#   fixes).
#
# - a "floating" part, which reflects the origin of the source code
#   used to compile the software. This is optional. The floating part
#   is important when software can be built from a SCM repository in
#   an intermediary state before the fixed part is updated.
#
# An example complete version number is "1.0.3", with only a fixed
# part. It reflects for instance the state of a software from a
# polished release, e.g. the outcome of "make dist" immediately after
# the fixed version number was committed into the SCM repository.
#
# Another example is "1.0.3.77-a7d8f", where 1.0.3 is the fixed part
# and "77-a7d8f" is the floating part. This would be the version
# generated from a git repository at the commit identified by "a7d8f",
# 77 commits after the commit where the fixed part was set.
#
# Another example is "1.0.3.77-3124". This would be the version
# generated from a SVN repository at revision "3124", when "3124" is
# 77 revisions after the fixed version number was set.
#
# Other examples are "1.0.3.77-a7d8f-dirty" and "1.0.3.77-3124-dirty".
# The suffix "-dirty" is appended when the version string is
# generated from a source tree with changes not committed to the
# SCM repository.
#
# In order to use intra-version strings in your project, you will
# need two separate automatically generated version string files:
#
# .tarball-version - present only in a distribution tarball, and not
#   in a checked-out repository.  Created with contents that were
#   learned at the last time autoconf was run, and used by
#   version-gen.  Must not be present in either $(srcdir) or
#   $(builddir) for version-gen to give accurate answers during normal
#   development with a checked out tree, but must be present in a
#   tarball when there is no version control system.  Therefore, it
#   cannot be used in any dependencies. The Makefile should contain
#   hooks to check that the value is up-to-date at distribution or
#   installation time, without penalizing normal development with
#   extra reconfigures.
#
# .version - present in a checked-out repository and in a distribution
#   tarball.  Usable in dependencies, particularly for files that
#   don't want to depend on config.h but do want to track version
#   changes.  Delete this file prior to any autoconf run where you
#   want to rebuild files to pick up a version string change; and
#   leave it stale to minimize rebuild time after unrelated changes to
#   configure sources.
# It is probably wise to add these two files to .gitignore or
# svn:ignore, so that you don't accidentally commit either generated
# file.
#
# Use the following line in your configure.ac, so that $(VERSION) will
# automatically be up-to-date each time configure is run (and note
# that since configure.ac no longer includes a version string,
# Makefile rules should not depend on configure.ac for version
# updates).
#
# AC_INIT([Your project],
#         m4_esyscmd([build-aux/version-gen build-aux/tarball-version build-aux/package-version]),
#         [bug-project@example])
#
# Then use the following lines in your Makefile.am, so that .version
# will be present for dependencies, and so that .tarball-version will
# exist in distribution tarballs.
#
# EXTRA_DIST = .version
# BUILT_SOURCES = $(top_srcdir)/.version
# $(top_srcdir)/.version:
#	echo $(VERSION) > $@-t && mv $@-t $@
# dist-hook:
#	echo $(VERSION) > $(distdir)/.tarball-version
