\chapter{\label{chapter:intro}Introduction}

This document is a technical reference to the Microgrid architecture, developed by the Computer Systems Architecture group at the University of Amsterdam. This document is meant for everyone who will work with, work on, or is interested in the architecture.

The document begins with a high-level overview of the multicore processor and how it interfaces with the rest of the system. Subsequent chapters will focus in on the components on the processor such as the cores themselves, the memory network, the delegation and link networks and the I/O interface. Going further, the components and processes on each core are described that together give the microgrid its unique performance properties.
