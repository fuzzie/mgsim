Character matrix display
========================

The MG matrix display is text-oriented output device. It provides both
grid addressing of individual characters and a serial interface with
automatic management of line feeds, tabs and scrolling.

The device presents itself to the I/O bus as a single device. 

========== ============ ====== =============================
Address    Access width Mode   Description
========== ============ ====== =============================
0          4 bytes      Read   Display size (see below)
0 to W*H-1 (any)        Write  Grid-addressed output buffer
W*H        1 byte       Write  Serial output
========== ============ ====== =============================

This address space can be considered as 3 separate devices:

- the first 32-bit word, when read from, indicates the size of the
  character matrix. The low-order 16 bits indicate the height, and the
  high-order 16 bits indicate the width. This must be accessed
  as a single 32-bit operation.

- Given the matrix size WxH, the first WxH bytes of the address space
  accessed by writes correspond to the output buffer to the
  display. The buffer is ordered row-major, with horizontally
  consecutive characters placed at consecutives addresses.  This
  buffer can be accessed with any operation size (addressing with byte
  granularity) as long as no single operation causes an access past
  the buffer boundary.

- The byte address immediately after the output buffer is the
  serial interface. The matrix display internally maintains
  a "current position" and handles newlines, form feeds and
  tab characters.

Unprintable characters are ignored.
