UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)
==================================================

The MG UART device allows to connect the Microgrid to an external
(serial) terminal. It tries to mimics the NS/PC16550D standard UART
chip: http://www.national.com/ds/PC/PC16550D.pdf

The UART device presents itself to the I/O bus as a single device. It
must be accessed using 8-bit I/O operations. Its device address space
follows the NS/PC16550D specification as follows:

======== ======= =====================================
Register Mode    Description
======== ======= =====================================
0        R       Receiver Buffer Register / FIFO input
0        W       Transmit Hold Register (THR) / FIFO output
1        R/W     Interrupt Enable Register (IER)
2        R       Interrupt Identification Register (IIR)
2        W       FIFO Control Register (FCR)
3        R/W     Line Control Register (LCR)
4        R/W     MODEM Control Register (MCR)
5        R/W     Line Status Register (LSR)
6        R/W     MODEM Status Register (MSR)
7        R/W     Scratch register
8        R/W     (MG extension) Interrupt channel for THRE interrupts
9        R/W     (MG extension) Interrupt channel for output FIFO underruns
10       R/W     (MG extension) UART enable/disable
======== ======= =====================================

To change the notification channel number, it is recommended to first
disable notifications (reset IER1), so as to cancel any pending
notification to the old channel number.

Differences with NS/PC16650D
----------------------------

- Line and MODEM status are not supported. However loopback mode can be
  configured and used (MCR4)
- the FIFO mode is always enabled, and cannot be disabled (FCR0 is
  fixed to 1).
- the FIFO buffers cannot be reset (FCR1/2 are inoperative)
- DMA is not supported (FCR3 is inoperative)
- transmit speed / divisor latch is not supported (and DLAB is inoperative)
