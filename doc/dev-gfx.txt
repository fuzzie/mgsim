Graphical framebuffer
=====================

The MG graphical display is a 2D image output device. It provides a
fixed set of SVGA resolutions and output via a linear framebuffer.

The device presents itself to the I/O bus as two separate device: the
*control* device and the *framebuffer* device.

When multiple graphical outputs are connected to a bus, the device
identifier of the framebuffers can be matched to their control devices
via word 7 of the control device. (see below).

Control device
--------------

The gfx control device must be accessed using 32-bit I/O
operations. Its device address space is as follows:

============= ======= ===========================================
32-bit word   Mode    Description
============= ======= ===========================================
0             R       Boolean: indicates whether the physical screen is connected
1             R       Current width in pixels
2             R       Current height in pixels
3             R       Current pixel mode (see below)
0             W       Command: commit the mode configured using words 1-3
1             W       Desired width in pixels
2             W       Desired height in pixels
3             W       Desired pixel mode (see below)
4             W       Command: dump the framebuffer contents
5             R/W     Image index (key) for the next dump       
6             R       Maximum supported width
7             R       Maximum supported height
8             R       Screen refresh interval in bus clock cycles
9             R       Device identifier of the corresponding framebuffer device on the I/O bus
256-511       R/W     Color palette (one 32-bit word per color index)
============= ======= ===========================================

Pixel mode
``````````

The pixel mode in word 3 indicates the layout of pixel data in the
frame buffer and how pixel values are rendered on screen. The
following values are allowed:

============= ================== =======================================================
Pixel mode    FB pixel width     Description
============= ================== =======================================================
8             1 byte per pixel   Each FB value is rendered as a 2-3-3 RGB pixel.
65544         1 byte per pixel   Each FB value indexes a word in the palette, which is rendered as a 8-8-8 RGB value.
16            2 bytes per pixel  Each FB value is rendered as a 5-6-5 RGB pixel.
24            3 bytes per pixel  Each FB value is rendered as a 8-8-8 RGB pixel.
32            4 bytes per pixel  Each FB value is rendered as a 8-8-8 RGB pixel. The upper 8 bits are ignored.
============= ================== =======================================================


Display mode control
````````````````````

When read from, words 1-3 indicate the current display mode. 


The following process configures a new mode:

1. the desired mode is written into words 1-3

2. the command word 0 is written to, to commit the desired mode

3. the words 1-3 are read back to check whether the mode was accepted. 

Invalid mode configurations are ignored.

Framebuffer device
------------------

The framebuffer device can be accessed using any I/O data width, as
long as no address past the framebuffer size is accessed.

The data in the framebuffer is organized as per the `Pixel mode`_
explained above, using row-major addressing (horizontally adjacent
pixels have consecutive addresses in the device address space).
