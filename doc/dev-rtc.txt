Real-time clock
===============

The MG RTC device allows to sample real time (outside of the
simulation environment) and signal asynchronous events to the
Microgrid at configurable time periods.

The RTC device presents itself to the I/O bus as a single device. It
must be accessed using 32-bit I/O operations. Its device address space
is as follows:

============= ======= ===========================================
32-bit word   Mode    Description
============= ======= ===========================================
0             R       Clock resolution in microseconds of real time
1             R/W     Notification delay (in microseconds, set to 0 to disable notifications)
2             R/W     Notification channel to use for notifications
3             R/W     Boolean: whether to deliver all events
4             R       Microseconds part of the current Greenwich time since Jan 1, 1970
5             R       Seconds part of the current Greenwich time since Jan 1, 1970
6             R       Packed UTC time/date (part 1, see below)
7             R       Packed UTC time/date (part 2, see below)
8             R       Packed local time/date (part 1, see below)
9             R       Packed local time/date (part 2, see below)
============= ======= ===========================================

To change the notification channel number, it is recommended to first
disable notifications (set the delay to 0), so as to cancel any
pending notification to the old channel number.

Notifications
-------------

When enabled, the RTC device will deliver an I/O notification
(interrupt request) at the specified time period. If the I/O bus is
busy it is possible that the notification cannot be sent for an entire
period. In this case, the value of word 3 determines whether
intermediate notifications are skipped or whether they will be
delivered eventually.

Packed time
-----------

Words 6-9 provide a broken-down description of the current time and
date, analogous to ``struct tm`` in C. The format is as follows:

==== ======= =======================
Word Bits    Description
==== ======= =======================
6,8  0-5     Seconds (0-59)
6,8  6-11    Minutes (0-59)
6,8  12-16   Hours (0-23)
6,8  17-21   Day in month (0-30)
6,8  22-25   Month in year (0-11)
6,8  26-31   Number of years since 1970 (0-63)
7,9  0-3     Day of week (Sunday = 0)
7,9  4-12    Day of year (0-365)
7,9  13      Whether summer time is in effect
7,9  14-31   Offset from UTC in seconds (0-86399)
